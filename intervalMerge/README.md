# intervalMerge

## Problem description

Write a function that takes a list of intervals as input, e.g. `[(1, 3), (4, 5), (8, 10), (9, 12)]'. The function should then merge all overlapping intervals and return a list of all merged intervals. For example, the input above should yield the output `[(1, 5), (8, 12)]`.
