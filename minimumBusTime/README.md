# minimumBusTime

## Problem description

Write a function that takes as input one array, 'busTime', containing time taken for a given bus to make one trip, and an integer, 'totalTrips', which corresponds to the total number of required trips made by all buses put together. The function should then find the minimum required time for the buses to make the required number of trips. For example, `busTime = [10, 15, 20, 30]`, `totalTrips = 15`, should return `60`.
