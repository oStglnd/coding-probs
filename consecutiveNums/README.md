# consecutiveNums

## Problem description

Write a function that takes a list of integers as input. The function should then determine the *number of integers* additional integers required to make the list of integers complete and consecutive. For example, an input of `[1, 3, 4`] should output `1` as we would only need to input `[2]` in order to make the list consecutive.
